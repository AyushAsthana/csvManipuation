--------------------- how to run jar --------------------

1) Assignment folder contains 'TestProject' folder , it is java project which contains src, target and pom file .

2) Open terminal at location 'TestProject' . 

3) run command 'mvn clean' . This will delete target folder .

4) Now , run command 'mvn package' . It will generate two jars inside target folder -- TestProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar and TestProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

5) now , in terminal , change working directory to 'target' folder , i.e. cd target

6) now , run this jar ---TestProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar .  While running , you have to supply path of Sales.csv file and on flag 1 or 2 ...  example  --

java -jar TestProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /home/ayush/Downloads 2
java -jar TestProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /home/ayush/Downloads 1 

7) first command pass 2 as flag , which will generate AccountDeatinsJSON.txt at the path specified  '/home/ayush/Downloads' , a file containing all the sales where account created date is  before or in 2008  .


8)  second command pass 1 as flag , which will generate SalesUpdated.csv at the path specified  '/home/ayush/Downloads' , a file with Account Age column generated by finding difference between todays date and Account Created Date . 


Note : Sales.csv is inside Assignement folder . Use this file , as it does not contains null values for any field .
